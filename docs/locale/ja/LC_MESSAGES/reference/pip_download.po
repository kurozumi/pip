"``pip download`` does the same resolution and downloading as ``pip "
"install``, but instead of installing the dependencies, it collects the "
"downloaded distributions into the directory provided (defaulting to the "
"current directory). This directory can later be passed as the value to "
"``pip install --find-links`` to facilitate offline or locked down package"
" installation."

"``pip download`` with the ``--platform``, ``--python-version``, "
"``--implementation``, and ``--abi`` options provides the ability to fetch"
" dependencies for an interpreter and system other than the ones that pip "
"is running on. ``--only-binary=:all:`` is required when using any of "
"these options. It is important to note that these options all default to "
"the current system/interpreter, and not to the most restrictive "
"constraints (e.g. platform any, abi none, etc). To avoid fetching "
"dependencies that happen to match the constraint of the current "
"interpreter (but not your target one), it is recommended to specify all "
"of these options if you are specifying one of them. Generic dependencies "
"(e.g. universal wheels, or dependencies with no platform, abi, or "
"implementation constraints) will still match an over- constrained "
"download requirement."

"This forces OSX 10.10 or lower compatibility. Since OSX deps are forward "

"platform ``any``. Also force the interpreter version to ``27`` (or more "
